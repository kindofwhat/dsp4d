# Results

## Classification Task

<!-- Results of document classification experiments -->

## Action Generation Task

<!-- Results of clinical action generation experiments -->

### Breakpoint Analysis

<!-- Where do models fail? At what complexity? -->

### Size vs. Accuracy Trade-offs

<!-- Main findings with tables and figures -->
