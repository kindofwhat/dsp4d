# Introduction

Doctors face an increasing volume of medical documents requiring timely review
and action. After office hours, the challenge of efficiently processing X-ray
results, lab reports, and specialist referrals becomes critical for patient care.

This research addresses a fundamental question: *What is the smallest LLM that
can reliably classify medical documents and generate appropriate clinical
actions?*
  
## Motivation

<!-- Describe the problem and why it matters -->

## Research Questions

1. What is the minimum model size for reliable document classification (>95% accuracy)?
2. How do different context engineering strategies affect the size-accuracy trade-off?
3. Can sub-3B parameter models achieve clinical safety standards with appropriate context?
